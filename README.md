## What is TypeScript?

Created by Microsoft, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that
anything that is possible in JavaScript is possible in TypeScript. TypeScript
inherits all the functionality of JavaScript, but has additional features
and syntax.

TypeScript compiles into JavaScript, since the browser cannot read TypeScript.
TypeScript is easily integrated into JavaScript projects, and it was designed
for the development of large applications. It can be used for small projects,
but it may not be necessary or advisable for a smaller codebase.

## What does TypeScript offer?

1. Static Type Checking: By default, JavaScript is a weakly typed language,
   which means that variable and function types do not need to be specified.
   Languages like Java require you to specify types, which may seem like an extra
   step, but it provides certain advantages.

- Completely optional
- Helps identify and prevent bugs and mitigate future issues
- Improves readability and code descriptiveness

2. Class-Based Programming: A style of Object-Oriented Programming. With ES5, it
   was necessary to use the prototype chain in order to implement this paradigm.
   ES6 provides syntactic sugar in the form of the `class` keyword, and TypeScript
   is fully compatible with ES6. In fact, TypeScript introduced the ability to use
   classes before their official implementation in ES6.

Overall, TypeScript uses a syntax that's closer to that of languages like Java
or Scala.

## What types can be used in TypeScript?

1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. Array
5. Any
6. Void
7. Null
8. Tuple
9. Enum
10. Generics
